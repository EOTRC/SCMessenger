# SCMessenger Transport Architecture

> Design and implementation narrative. For current verified runtime/test status, use `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`.

Complete implementation of sovereign mesh networking with zero external dependencies.

## [Current] Overview

The SCMessenger transport layer implements a fully decentralized, self-healing peer-to-peer network where every node contributes to routing, discovery, and reliability. There are no special "bootstrap nodes" or "relay servers"—all nodes are equal participants that help each other based on their capability.

## [Current] Seven-Phase Implementation

### [Current] Phase 1: Real Address Observation 

**Problem**: Nodes need to know their external IP addresses to advertise connectivity, but cannot rely on external STUN servers.

**Solution**: Peer-observed address discovery with consensus.

**Components**:

- `AddressObserver`: Aggregates observations from multiple peers
- `ConnectionTracker`: Monitors active connections and endpoints
- Consensus algorithm: Most-observed address wins

**How it works**:

1. When peers connect, each observes the other's remote address
2. Address reflection protocol exchanges observations
3. AddressObserver counts observations per address
4. Consensus calculated: most confirmations = primary external address
5. **Auto-Advertisement**: Verified consensus addresses are automatically added to the swarm via `swarm.add_external_address()`.

**Result**: Nodes discover and advertise their actual public IPs without external STUN servers.

**Code**: `core/src/transport/observation.rs`

### [Current] Phase 2: Multi-Port Adaptive Listening 

**Problem**: Restrictive networks may block common P2P ports.

**Solution**: Listen on multiple ports simultaneously (443, 80, 0).

**Result**: Nodes maximize connectivity by trying multiple ports, with automatic fallback.

**Code**: `core/src/transport/multiport.rs`

---

### [Current] Phase 3: Relay Capability 

**Problem**: Direct P2P may fail due to NAT/firewall restrictions.

**Solution**: Every node can relay messages for others via `/p2p-circuit/`.

**Result**: Messages reach peers even behind restrictive NATs via community relays.

**Code**: `core/src/transport/mesh_routing.rs` (RelayStats)

---

### [Current] Phase 4: Mesh-Based Discovery 

**Problem**: Traditional P2P requires hardcoded "bootstrap nodes".

**Solution**: Peers propagate through the mesh itself, so no address list needs
to be shipped. Two complementary mechanisms:

- **Ledger exchange** (`/sc/ledger-exchange/1.0.0`) -- the mechanism that
  replaced static bootstrap lists for learning about *remote* peers. Nodes gossip
  the peer records they already hold to the peers they are connected to, and
  persist what they receive. Records are gained from `PeerIdentified` and
  `LedgerReceived` events and shared via `to_shared_entries()` / `share_ledger()`.
- **Local discovery** -- mDNS on the LAN (desktop; `NsdManager` on Android), plus
  BLE, Wi-Fi Aware / Wi-Fi Direct, and Multipeer. Finds neighbours with no
  configuration and no internet.

Kademlia DHT lookups and libp2p `identify` then extend reach once at least one
connection exists. Any node can serve as an entry point, because every node is a
full relay -- there is no privileged entry tier.

**Result**: All compiled-in address lists are empty (`CORE_BOOTSTRAP_NODES`,
`DEFAULT_BOOTSTRAP_NODES`). Network entry is possible via any peer; no single
point of failure and no shipped infrastructure dependency. The only manual step
is one user-supplied address on a cold start with an empty ledger and no local
peers.

**Code**: `core/src/transport/behaviour.rs` (protocol registration),
`core/src/store/ledger_entry.rs` (`LedgerManager`), `cli/src/ledger.rs`.
Joining model: `docs/BOOTSTRAP.md`.

### [Current] Phase 5: Reputation Tracking 

**Problem**: Unreliable relays could degrade performance.

**Solution**: Track relay performance and prioritize reliable nodes.

**Result**: Network self-optimizes by routing through best-performing relays.

---

### [Current] Phase 6: Continuous Retry Logic 

**Problem**: Messages must be delivered reliably even when best paths fail.

**Solution**: Multi-path delivery with continuous retry and exponential backoff.

**Result**: Maximum delivery reliability; messages eventually reach destination.

---

### [Current] Phase 7: Automatic Port Mapping (UPnP) 

**Problem**: Manual port forwarding is complex for average users.

**Solution**: Integrated UPnP mapping.

**Components**:

- `libp2p::upnp`: Automated gateway discovery and port mapping.
- **Auto-Advertisement**: Mapped addresses are immediately added to the swarm for global visibility.

**Result**: Zero-configuration P2P connectivity for users with UPnP-compatible routers.

**Code**: `core/src/transport/swarm.rs`, `core/src/behaviour.rs`
