// Connection Ledger — Persistent peer discovery storage
//
// Philosophy: "A node is a node." IP is the source of truth.
//
// The ledger stores every successful IP:Port pair we've connected to.
// On startup, we load the ledger and attempt to reconnect to all known peers.
// If a peer presents a different PeerID (e.g., after restart), we accept it,
// update the ledger, and carry on. Unreachable peers enter exponential backoff
// but are never deleted — they may come back.

// Address filtering lives in the core crate now (adversarial review F3): core's
// ledger-seed import, its seed-dial candidate build and its ledger-exchange
// response all need the same rules, and having two definitions of "dialable" in
// one workspace is how core ended up with none. These re-exports keep every
// existing `ledger::is_dialable_multiaddr` / `ledger::NetworkMode` call site
// working unchanged.
//
// Behavioural deltas versus the previous CLI-local implementation, all
// strictly-tightening: multicast, broadcast, 0.0.0.0/8, 192.0.0.0/24,
// IPv4-mapped IPv6 (`::ffff:127.0.0.1`) and IPv6 unique-local (`fc00::/7`, in
// Public mode) are now rejected, and a string with no transport component at
// all -- including `""`, which `Multiaddr` happily parses -- is no longer
// reported as dialable.
//
// Re-review NEW-1: `is_dialable_multiaddr` also takes a [`DnsPolicy`], because a
// `/dns4/...` address resolves to whatever its zone owner chooses at dial time,
// so none of the IP rules can be applied to it.
//
// CHOKE-POINT REFACTOR (2026-07-26). This file used to maintain the invariant
// "a DNS-form address may enter the CLI ledger only through `add_bootstrap`",
// and `dialable_addresses` DEPENDED on it -- it passed `AllowLocallyConfigured`
// for every entry. The invariant was false: `record_connection` hardcoded
// `AllowLocallyConfigured` and `cmd_start`'s `PeerIdentified` handler fed it the
// remote's advertised `listen_addrs` unfiltered. Two changes remove the
// dependency instead of restating the invariant:
//
//   1. `record_connection` takes `DnsPolicy` as a REQUIRED parameter, and the
//      only production callers reach it through `record_identified_peer`, which
//      passes `Reject`.
//   2. `dialable_addresses` derives the policy per entry from `is_bootstrap`
//      (set only by `add_bootstrap`), so it is sound even if some future path
//      does store a name.
