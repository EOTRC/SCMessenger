"""PreToolUse hook: block Bash commands that have previously caused expensive,
silent damage in this repo, and print the SOP instead.

Each guard replaces a prose rule that cost standing context tokens on every agent
spawn and could still be forgotten. A hook costs nothing until it fires and
cannot be skipped.

Guards:
  1. cargo clean       -- wipes ALL of target/ regardless of --target (44.7 GB
                          measured loss) and can destroy
                          core/target/generated-sources/.
  2. worker dispatch   -- agy without --add-dir times out; without a pinned
                          --model it can silently spend Anthropic quota;
                          delegate_task.py without --mode silently truncates.
  3. build deconflict  -- concurrent build tools corrupt target/ in ways that
                          read as source errors.
  4. destructive ops   -- `reset --hard`, `checkout -- <paths>`, `restore`,
                          `clean -f`, `rebase`, force-push, and recursive
                          force-deletes outside tmp//target/. security.md
                          already required operator approval for these; on
                          2026-08-08 a concurrent agent ran four of them in
                          sequence and destroyed another session's work.
  5. repeat mistakes   -- patterns proven to fail repeatedly in this repo.
  6. stale checkout    -- repo gates run from a stale checkout silently run the
                          stale gate script, and stale gates fail in the safe-
                          looking direction. On 2026-08-15, a stale pr_scope.sh
                          reported [OK] on PR #139 because of an old 100-file
                          API cap, missing 6 merge-blocked crypto/transport
                          files that the current gate caught.
  7. commit hygiene    -- git commit with staged trailing whitespace, blank-
                          line-at-EOF, or emoji. Repository Hygiene went red
                          twice on PR #139 from committing unverified artifacts.

MATCHING: commands are tokenized with shlex and split into shell segments, and a
guard only fires when the trigger sits at a COMMAND POSITION. Substring matching
was tried first and was wrong in both directions:
  - false positive: `python -c "print('cargo clean')"` blocked, because the
    string appears as data. This blocked a legitimate test harness.
  - false negative: `grep x docs/ && cargo clean` allowed, because the command
    merely STARTED with an inspection verb, so the whole line was skipped.
Segment-aware matching fixes both. `bash -c "..."` payloads are recursed into,
bounded by _MAX_DEPTH.

Contract: exit 0 allows, exit 2 blocks and feeds stderr back to the agent.
Fails OPEN -- any internal error allows the command through, because a broken
hook must never wedge the session. If shlex cannot parse the command, falls back
to conservative substring matching (blocks more, never less).

Escape hatches (deliberate, per-guard). Honoured both from the environment and
as an inline `VAR=1 <command>` prefix -- see override(); checking only
os.environ silently made every hatch unusable, since this hook runs as its own
process before the command does.

    session's uncommitted work (core/Cargo.toml, scripts/build_wiring_graph.py,
    and two generated JSON files). Unstaged changes never enter the object
    store, so there was no recovery path: not reflog, not fsck, not stash.

    The distinction is CONSEQUENCE, not path shape. Restoring a clean path
    discards nothing; restoring a dirty one is unrecoverable. Both are spelled
    identically, so the guard asks git which case it is:

# --- Guard 6: stale checkout ------------------------------------------------
#
# A repo gate run from a stale checkout silently runs the STALE gate script,
# and stale gates fail in the safe-looking direction.
#
# On 2026-08-15, two CTO sessions ran concurrently. The shared checkout sat 23
# commits behind tracking. `scripts/pr_scope.sh` there was therefore the OLD
# version, which derived its file list from `gh pr view --json files` -- an API
# that silently capped at 100 files. PR #139 changed 253 files. Run from the
# stale checkout, the gate printed:
#     [OK]      clear of core/src/{crypto,transport,routing,privacy}
# Run from a current checkout, the SAME gate on the SAME PR printed:
#     [BLOCKER] touches merge-blocked directories (AGENTS.md rule 8):
#                 core/src/crypto/backup.rs
#                 core/src/transport/addr_filter.rs
#                 core/src/transport/behaviour.rs
#                 core/src/transport/dial_policy.rs
#                 core/src/transport/observation.rs
#                 core/src/transport/swarm.rs
#
# The gate reported PASS while six merge-blocked files were invisible to it.
# The repair was already committed (#158), but was not in the checkout where the
# runbook instructed people to run it.
#
# This guard blocks when a repo gate/verification script is invoked from a
# working tree whose HEAD is behind base refs without performing network operations.

# --- Guard 7: commit hygiene ------------------------------------------------

# Repository Hygiene went red on PR #139 on 2026-08-15 and again on 2026-08-16
# from committing files verbatim carrying trailing whitespace.
# AGENTS.md rule 1 bans emoji across all code and docs; staged commits were a gap.
#
# This guard blocks `git commit` when staged content contains whitespace errors
# (trailing whitespace, blank-line-at-EOF) or emoji characters.
