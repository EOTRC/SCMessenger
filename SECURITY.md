## Reporting a Vulnerability

**IMPORTANT:** Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities in public GitHub issues.

### How to Report

GitHub's private vulnerability reporting is the only security reporting channel for this project. There is no security mailing address.

1. Go to https://github.com/Sovereign-Communication/SCMessenger/security/advisories
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**
3. Fill out the advisory form with the details listed below and submit

The report is visible only to you and the maintainers until an advisory is published. Private reporting is enabled on this repository and is free to use.

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Clear description** of the vulnerability
- **Affected component(s)** and version/commit
- **Reproduction steps** or proof-of-concept details
- **Impact assessment** (what can an attacker do?)
- **Suggested mitigation** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

2. **Initial Assessment** (Within 7 days)
   - Validate the vulnerability
   - Assess severity and impact
   - Determine affected versions
   - Provide initial timeline

3. **Fix Development** (Timeline varies by severity)
   - Develop and test fix
   - Prepare security advisory
   - Coordinate disclosure timeline

4. **Release and Disclosure** (Coordinated)
   - Release patched version
   - Publish security advisory

## Severity Classification

We use a modified CVSS-based severity classification:

### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)

**Characteristics:**
- Remote code execution
- Complete system compromise
- Cryptographic key extraction
- Mass data breach

**Response Time:** Fix within 7 days

**Examples:**
- Remote code execution in message parser
- Private key extraction vulnerability
- Authentication bypass allowing full access

### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)

**Characteristics:**
- Significant data exposure
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation
- Denial of service (persistent)

**Response Time:** Fix within 14 days

**Examples:**
- Message content decryption without key
- Identity spoofing vulnerability
- Persistent crash causing data loss

### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)

**Characteristics:**
- Limited data exposure
- Denial of service (temporary)
- Information disclosure
- Security feature bypass

**Response Time:** Fix within 30 days

**Examples:**
- Metadata leakage
- Temporary service disruption
- Timing side-channel

### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)

**Characteristics:**
- Minimal impact
- Requires significant preconditions
- Theoretical vulnerability
- Best practice violation

**Response Time:** Fix in next release

**Examples:**
- Minor information disclosure
- Hardening opportunity
- Configuration issue

## Response Time Expectations

| Severity | Acknowledgment | Initial Assessment | Fix Target | Disclosure |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|------------|------------|
| Critical | 24 hours | 48 hours | 7 days | Coordinated |
| High | 48 hours | 7 days | 14 days | Coordinated |
| Medium | 72 hours | 14 days | 30 days | Coordinated |
| Low | 7 days | 30 days | Next release | Coordinated |

**Note:** These are target timelines. Actual response may vary based on complexity and resources.

## Public Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Vulnerabilities reported privately
2. **Fix Development**: Fix developed and tested privately
3. **Coordinated Release**: Fix released before public disclosure
4. **Public Advisory**: Security advisory published after fix
5. **Credit**: Reporter credited (if desired)

### Disclosure Timeline

- **Standard**: 90 days from initial report
- **Critical**: Expedited (7-14 days)
- **Extensions**: By mutual agreement

### What We Publish

Security advisories include:

- Vulnerability description
- Affected versions
- Fixed versions
- Severity rating
- Mitigation steps
- Credit to reporter (if desired)

### What We Don't Publish

- Detailed exploitation techniques
- Proof-of-concept code (initially)
- Information that could aid attackers

## Security Posture Notes

### Current Security Status

SCMessenger is designed around end-to-end encryption, identity ownership, and infrastructure independence. However, as an alpha-stage project, the following caveats apply:

Markers: `[OK]` implemented, `[PARTIAL]` implemented but incomplete or unreviewed, `[WIP]` in development, `[NO]` not implemented.

**Cryptographic Design:**
- [OK] Ed25519 for identity and signatures
- [OK] X25519 ECDH for key exchange
- [OK] XChaCha20-Poly1305 for encryption
- [OK] Blake3 for hashing
- [PARTIAL] Cryptographic implementation under active review

**Security Features:**
- [OK] End-to-end encryption
- [OK] Forward secrecy via double-ratchet session keys (`core/src/crypto/ratchet.rs`), including a post-quantum-augmented ratchet step
- [OK] Identity verification
- [WIP] Onion routing
- [WIP] Cover traffic

**Platform Security:**
- [OK] Android: ProGuard/R8 enabled for release builds
- [OK] iOS: App Transport Security (ATS) configured
- [OK] WASM: Sandboxed execution
- [PARTIAL] Secure key storage (platform-dependent)

### Known Limitations

1. **Alpha Status**: Not yet recommended for production use
2. **Audit Status**: No formal security audit completed
3. **Key Management**: Secure key storage varies by platform
4. **Network Security**: Transport security under active development
5. **Side Channels**: Timing and traffic analysis mitigations in progress

### Security Roadmap

See current release and risk posture in:
- [docs/CURRENT_STATE.md](docs/CURRENT_STATE.md)
- [HANDOFF/V1_0_0_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](HANDOFF/V1_0_0_EXECUTION_PLAN.md) — sequencing toward v1.0.0
- [docs/V0.2.0_RESIDUAL_RISK_REGISTER.md](docs/V0.2.0_RESIDUAL_RISK_REGISTER.md) — risk register, carried forward from the v0.2.0 cycle

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Verify Identity**: Verify contact identities out-of-band
3. **Secure Device**: Use device encryption and strong passwords
4. **Network Security**: Be cautious on untrusted networks
5. **Backup Keys**: Securely backup identity keys

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**: All security-sensitive code requires review
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive tests for security features
3. **Dependencies**: Regular dependency audits
4. **Secrets**: Never commit secrets to git
5. **Unsafe Code**: All `unsafe` blocks require `// SAFETY:` comments

### For Operators

1. **Relay Security**: Secure relay node configurations
2. **Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious activity
3. **Updates**: Keep relay nodes updated
4. **Logging**: Secure log storage and rotation
5. **Access Control**: Restrict administrative access
