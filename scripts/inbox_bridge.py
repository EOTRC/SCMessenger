"""Bridge inbound SCMessenger messages into the orchestrator HANDOFF queue.

Option A of the message-handoff design: a poller that lives entirely outside
the Rust daemon. It reads the node's own decrypted history over the local
control API, turns each new inbound message from the allow-listed peer into a
HANDOFF/todo ticket, and only then sends an acknowledgement back to the phone.

Design rules this file is built around:

1.  The ACK is emitted AFTER the ticket is on disk and fsync'd, never on
    receipt. An ACK that fires on decrypt proves the transport worked and says
    nothing about whether the orchestrator will ever see the message.
2.  Idempotency is keyed on message_id. The retry -> duplicate delivery path is
    a known behaviour of this stack, so a redelivered message must collapse to
    the ticket that already exists rather than dispatching the orchestrator
    twice.
3.  The allow-list is exact-match on the peer identifier as the node itself
    reports it in history. Nothing is derived from storage/ledger.json: that
    ledger is known to bind peer identities to addresses that are not theirs,
    so it is not an identity source.
4.  Non-allow-listed senders get no ticket and no ACK. Staying silent avoids
    turning the bridge into an oracle that confirms which node is listening.
5.  Inbound content from an allow-listed peer splits into three routes.
    First, the Android/iOS apps wrap EVERY outbound message -- protocol
    housekeeping and real human text alike -- in the same scm.message.*
    JSON envelope, so the envelope is unwrapped first (see
    classify_content()/extract_text()) to get the actual text underneath.
    A message whose kind marks it as protocol housekeeping (identity_sync,
    history_sync, history_sync_data -- periodic re-sync pings the phone
    sends every 1-3 minutes on its own, not something a human typed) or
    whose unwrapped text is empty gets NO ticket, NO chat-log entry, and NO
    reply of any kind -- it is only marked seen so it is not reprocessed.
    Of what remains, a message whose unwrapped text starts with /handoff
    becomes a HANDOFF ticket exactly as before (the /handoff token itself is
    stripped before the body reaches the ticket). Anything else is ordinary
    chat -- no ticket, just an append to HANDOFF/logs/chat/<date>.jsonl and
    a lighter [SEEN] acknowledgement instead of [ACK].

Usage:
    python scripts/inbox_bridge.py discover   # list peers seen in history
    python scripts/inbox_bridge.py selftest   # check wiring, write nothing
    python scripts/inbox_bridge.py once       # single drain pass
    python scripts/inbox_bridge.py run        # poll forever
    python scripts/inbox_bridge.py status     # print the heartbeat file

    category is "housekeeping" or "content". `text` is the human-readable
    payload to actually act on: for the scm.message.* envelope format the
    Android/iOS apps wrap every outbound message in (control traffic and
    real chat alike -- see CONTROL_KINDS above for the evidence), that means
    the envelope's own `text` field; for anything else, `text` is `content`
    itself, unchanged, since plain-string content (e.g. from a CLI/desktop
    peer, which never wraps in this envelope) already IS the message.

    Housekeeping rules, in order, each conservative-by-construction: when in
    doubt this returns "content", never "housekeeping" -- silently
    swallowing a human message is worse than logging one stray control ping.

    1. Nothing here at all (content empty/whitespace after stripping) --
       there is no message to route either way, so it is dropped rather than
       logged or ticketed.
    2. content parses as a JSON object carrying a `kind` field (or a
       `schema`+`text` pair as a fallback shape): `kind` in CONTROL_KINDS is
       housekeeping unconditionally (this is what catches
       history_sync_data's non-empty text). `kind` missing/blank defaults to
       "text", mirroring the apps' own decode default (see
       decodeMessageWithIdentityHints()/DecodedMessagePayload in the Kotlin/
       Swift referenced above) -- an unrecognized/absent kind is NOT treated
       as housekeeping by itself.
    3. Whatever kind resolves to (recognized "text", or anything not in
       CONTROL_KINDS), an empty/whitespace `text` field inside the envelope
       is housekeeping -- there is nothing to relay, so nothing is swallowed
       by dropping it.

    Anything that doesn't parse as this envelope shape at all (no JSON, JSON
    that isn't an object, or an object with neither `kind` nor a
    `schema`+`text` pair) is passed straight through as ordinary content --
    including a message that merely contains JSON-looking text, or whose
    text happens to equal a control-kind name like "history_sync" as a
